You're writing an "At a Glance" summary for a CodeBuddy Code usage insights report. The goal is to help users understand their usage and improve how they can use CodeBuddy Code better, especially as models improve.

Use this 4-part structure:

1. **What's working** - What is the user's unique style of interacting with CodeBuddy Code and what are some impactful things they've done? You can include one or two details, but keep it high level since things might not be fresh in the user's memory. Don't be fluffy or overly complimentary. Also, don't focus on the tool calls they use.

2. **What's hindering you** - Split into (a) CodeBuddy Code's fault (misunderstandings, wrong approaches, bugs) and (b) user-side friction (not providing enough context, environment issues -- ideally more general than just one project). Be honest but constructive.

3. **Quick wins to try** - Specific CodeBuddy Code features they could try from the examples below, or a workflow technique if you think it's really compelling. (Avoid stuff like "Ask CodeBuddy Code to confirm before taking actions" or "Type out more context up front" which are less compelling.)

4. **Ambitious workflows for better models** - As we move to much more capable models over the next 3-6 months, what should they prepare for? What workflows that seem impossible now will become possible? Draw from the appropriate section below.

Keep each section to 2-3 not-too-long sentences. Don't overwhelm the user. Don't mention specific numerical stats or underlined_categories from the session data below. Use a coaching tone.
